<em> A full production and dev environment for Django and Vue. </em>

Djengu is a framework for creating decoupled web applications with Django and Vue.
It's essentially a cross-platform cookie-cutter. Most of the the heavy lifting in
setting up both development and production environments is taken care of, such as
server set-up, mock environments, containerization, SSL/TLS, DNS, testing, and much more.

The concept behind Djengu is that it will remove all reliance on itself once set up.
Djengu will create everything you need, then quietly remove itself –
leaving you with a clean, reliable, production-ready Django/Vue application.

At the moment, Djengu is limited to Django and Quasar Framework. Support for
Vue CLI and Nuxt.js will be added soon.

### Quick start

First, clone the repository.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:johnckealy/djengu.git
cd djengu
```

Djengu is controlled by a `Makefile`. To start, simply run

```bash
make
```

After a quick initial set up, you can run
```bash
make frontend-serve
```
then, in a new tab, run
```bash
make backend-serve
```
and your application will be ready.


### Installation

Djengu requires that the following tools be installed locally before starting.

– python-virtualenv

– node.js

– npm

### Simulating the production environment

Before setting up on a real server, it can be extremely useful to simulate
the production environment. Djengu makes use of Vagrant, a tool that allows you to make
changes in your dev environment while mirroring the production code in a virtual machine.

To use this feature, you'll need to install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads)
and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

The `Vagrantfile` controls the set up. If you don't wish to use this feature, you can
simply remove it.

Create the environment with
```bash
vagrant up
```
followed by
```bash
vagrant ssh
```

Firstly,
a separate Docker container running an instance of `CaddyServer` must be spun up.

Edit the `env/.env.prod` file to specify your directory structure on your VPS (keep the `/vagrant`
directory until the code is moved to your VPS), as well as your preferrred PostgreSQL settings.

Then, you can simply enter the `/vagrant` directory and run

```
make deploy-prod
```

Finally, you must enter your Vagrant instance's IP address in `/etc/hosts` and associate a
domain name to it. This must be the same domain name as the one specified in the `Caddyfile`.
Then hey presto – you have a reverse proxy – you can add new apps with unique domain names simply
by adding the entry to the Caddyfile and running `make deploy-prod` in the new app.

### Technologies

Because Djengu takes care of a lot of underlying technologies, certain
choices have already been made. This results in more simplicity and
speed, but less flexibility. Djengu will install with the
following technologies.

Django Rest Framework
– Quasar Framework (a Vue.js framework)
– PostgreSQL
– Docker
– Make
– Vagrant
– Github Actions
– JWT authentication
– Dj Rest Auth


If you'd like to see more choices, please consider contributing to the
project.

### Vscode

If you are a Visual Studio Code user, there are some premade scripts
for running the backend application in the `.vscode/` directory. If you don't
use vscode, just go ahead and delete this directory.

### Hosting multiple web applications on the same server instance

Because Djengu is decoupled by design, it is possible to host
several completely indendent applications on the same server
instance. This is done using CaddyServer's built-in reverse
proxy capability.

Everything is controlled from the `Caddyfile`, which will
install at `/caddy/Caddyfile` in production. You can add
extra applications and then reference the docker containers.
The important thing to remember when doing this is to use
unique port numbers for each instance, and reference these
port numbers in the `Caddyfile`.

### Flavours

Djengu currently has three choices (more will be added as the project progresses):

1) `Basic`: Creates a basic Quasar and Django application.

2) `Authentication`: Django and Quasar with JWT token authentication out of the box

3) `Static-site`: Runs a basic Quasar application with no Django backend

### Test Users

If you build Djengu with authentication, there is a test
account built in. The credentials are
```
username: guest
password: secret
```

You can also log in with username `admin` and the admin password
you entered during setup.
